-- =====================================
-- ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL INSIGHTS TO DISCOVER:
-- =====================================

-- 1. Is customer 1001647902 in user_info table?
-- 2. What's the complete lead hierarchy for this customer?
-- 3. Does this customer appear as an agent in audit_trail?
-- 4. What customer ID ranges exist and what do they represent?
-- 5. Why are most cust_id fields NULL in user_business_mapping?
-- 6. How do creator_cust_id and user_info.cust_id relate?
