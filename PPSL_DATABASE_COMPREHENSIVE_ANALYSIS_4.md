### **Customer ID Range Analysis:**

#### **🔍 ID Range Categories:**
- **< 1,000,000,000**: Legacy IDs (rare)
- **1,000,000,000 - 1,099,999,999**: **INTERNAL USERS/AGENTS** (like 1001647902)
- **1,100,000,000 - 1,199,999,999**: Customer Range 1 (regular customers)
- **1,200,000,000+**: Customer Range 2 (newer customers)

### **Customer-Lead Relationship Patterns:**

#### **🔗 Lead Creation Flow:**
```
Internal Agent (1001647902) 
    ↓ creates via OE Panel
Lead (creator_cust_id = 1001647902, cust_id = NULL)
    ↓ adds business owners
user_info records (cust_id = NULL, separate individuals)
    ↓ links via
user_business_mapping_owner (ownership structure)
```

#### **🏗️ Enterprise Lead Hierarchy:**
```
ROOT LEAD: 2be1c08d-3f70-4a6e-877e-0d79c5ff7f2c
├── Type: enterprise_merchant_business
├── Creator: 1001647902 (internal agent)
└── Children:
    └── 3dbba4bb-9ad9-43df-ae9a-d65925f8562e
        ├── Type: enterprise_merchant_parent
        └── Grandchildren:
            ├── fba1bc5b... (enterprise_merchant_aml)
            └── 4bf7b228... (enterprise_merchant_agreement_waive_off)
```

### **Customer ID Usage Patterns:**

#### **📊 Null Analysis Results:**
- **user_business_mapping.cust_id**: ~95% NULL (rarely used)
- **user_business_mapping.creator_cust_id**: ~98% populated (primary identifier)
- **user_info.cust_id**: ~60% populated (individual signatory data)

#### **🎯 Business Implications:**
1. **creator_cust_id = Primary Lead Tracking Identifier**
2. **Separation of Creator vs Owner** (internal agent creates, external owners sign)
3. **Test Data Prevalence** (significant internal testing in production DB)
4. **Hierarchical Business Processing** (parent-child lead structures)

### **System Design Insights:**

#### **✅ Why This Architecture Works:**
- **Flexibility**: Multiple ownership models supported
- **Auditability**: Clear creation vs ownership separation  
- **Scalability**: Hierarchical lead processing
- **Testing**: Internal accounts for safe development

#### **🚨 Potential Issues:**
- **Data Quality**: Test data mixed with production
- **Complexity**: Multiple customer ID fields can confuse
- **Performance**: Large test datasets impact queries
- **Reporting**: Need to filter internal accounts for business metrics

Notes:
- All relationships verified by sample COUNT() joins you executed (2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 86, 11, etc.).
- Some cust_id fields are intentionally NULL in user_business_mapping; creator_cust_id is primary for lead creation.

## 🧠 Conceptual Database Model (Understanding, not data)

- Core entity model
  - user_business_mapping (UBM): lead record; captures what (solution_type, level_2/3), who (creator_cust_id), when/how (channel, created_at), hierarchy (parent_lead_id), and links outward.
  - related_business_solution_mapping (RBSM): binds a business to a concrete solution instance; anchor for solution-scoped metadata/documents.
  - business: canonical business master tied via RBSM.

- Ownership model
  - user_business_mapping_owner: associates a UBM with one or more owners/signatories.
  - user_info: person record (name/email/phone/KYC-aligned fields) referenced by owners.
  - ubm_owner_ownership_type: role/type/ownership flavor for a given owner on a UBM.

- Document model
  - document: atomic document (type/status/uuid/encryption flag).
  - ubm_owner_document_mapping: owner-level documents (POI/POA/KYC).
  - business_document_mapping: business-level documents (registration/GST/etc.).
  - related_business_solution_document_mapping: solution-instance documents (agreements/benchmarking).

- Address model
  - address: normalized address with encryption flags.
  - ubm_owner_address_mapping: owner-address association.
  - business_address_mapping: business-address association.

- Solution metadata model
  - solution_additional_info (SAI): solution_id-scoped key-values (persistent configuration/state for the solution instance behind an RBSM).
  - related_business_solution_mapping_additional_info (RBSMAI): RBSM-scoped business logic payloads (PG_REQUEST, AML, agreements, QC outcomes, etc.).
  - user_business_mapping_additional_info (UBMAI): UBM-scoped flags/operational hints for the lead.

- Workflow and jobs (state progression)
  - workflow_node: designed states (stage/sub_stage/alias/description).
  - workflow_status: time-ordered snapshots of a UBM's current/previous node; forms the state history.
  - job: asynchronous execution (e.g., KYBSyncJob, PGMerchantCreationJob) keyed by context (context_key='ubm', context_val=UBM.id). Jobs mutate SAI/RBSMAI/UBMAI, which drives workflow_status transitions.

- Audit and compliance
  - generic_audit: operational audit for external calls (KYB/PG/AML) correlated by lead/solution context.
  - audit_event: internal business events (often linked to workflow_status_id) for stateful actions.
  - user_business_mapping_aud: temporal change history of UBM fields (who/what/when changed).
  - audit_trail: channel/device/session footprint (agent_cust_id centric for panels/apps).

- Identity semantics (why multiple "customer" ids)
  - creator_cust_id (UBM): actor who created the lead (often internal/agent in enterprise); primary for initiation/provenance.
  - user_info.cust_id: customer-number aligned to a person/signatory (KYC persona); used when identity must tie to a human.
  - ubm.cust_id: historically available; in enterprise onboarding typically not authoritative (often NULL by design).
  - agent_cust_id (audit_trail): session-actor on device/web; used for channel forensics.

- Relationship intent (how/why links exist)
  - UBM → RBSM anchors the lead to the business-solution instance; decouples capture-time intent from the eventual solution instance lifecycle.
  - Owners and user_info model legal/KYC signatories, distinct from the lead creator.
  - Documents/addresses attach at the correct responsibility level (owner/business/solution instance) for isolation and reusability.
  - Workflow+job orchestrate async progression; metadata tables (SAI/RBSMAI/UBMAI) store side-effects, validations, approvals, and drive subsequent transitions.

- Conceptual traversal patterns (cheatsheet)
  - Lead-centric: lead_id → UBM → RBSM → business → SAI/RBSMAI; owners via UBM_OWNER → user_info; docs/addresses via respective mappings; state via latest workflow_status → workflow_node; ops via generic_audit/audit_event; jobs via job(context_key='ubm', context_val=UBM.id).
  - Solution-centric: RBSM.id → business, solution_id → SAI; RBSMAI for runtime decisions; related docs via related_business_solution_document_mapping.
  - Owner-centric: user_info.id → UBM_OWNER → UBM; owner docs/addresses via owner mappings; ownership role via ubm_owner_ownership_type.

| bank_details_document_mapping (BDDM) | document (DOC) | document_id → id | many → one | Document linked to bank details |

Tips:
- If both RBSM.bank_details_id and business.bank_details_id exist, prefer RBSM-scoped association for solution-specific banking.
- For jobs, some deployments use `ubm_id`; others use `(context_key='ubm', context_val=UBM.id)`; treat both as UBM foreign keys.
- SAI is keyed by `solution_id` (not a pure FK); multiple SAI rows per solution_id are common (different keys over time).

// 6-table join for ownership verification (uses cust_id parameter)
fetchUBMByOwnershipTypeAndSolutionTypeAndStatusAndPanAndCustId()
// → Searches by user_info.cust_id (business signatory)

// KYB integration lookup (4-table join)
fetchUBMBySolutionSolutionTypeLevel2AndStatusAndUbmaiKeyValue()
// → Used for external API integration matching

// Business fetching by role (4-table join, uses cust_id parameter)
fetchUBMByRoleAndCustIdAndOwnershipTypeAndStatusAndSolutionTypeList()
// → Searches by user_info.cust_id (ownership role-based)
```

#### **🆔 Customer ID Query Patterns:**
- **creator_cust_id queries**: Filter by lead creator (internal agents/customers)
- **user_info.cust_id queries**: Filter by business signatory/owner
- **Complex joins**: Link creator → lead → owners → business entities
- **Null handling**: Most queries handle NULL cust_id gracefully

#### **📊 Query Categories:**
1. **HQL Queries (8 methods)**: Standard CRUD operations
2. **Native SQL Queries (5 methods)**: Complex business logic
3. **Single Table Queries (3 methods)**: Direct entity access
4. **Relationship Queries (4 methods)**: Multi-table joins

#### **🔗 Table Dependencies & Data Flow:**
The DAO directly interacts with **13 core tables** with specific data flow patterns:

**Primary Flow (Lead Management):**
```
UserBusinessMappingDaoImpl
    ↓ save() method
user_business_mapping (Root entity)
    ↓ cascades to
user_business_mapping_owner (Ownership structure)
    ↓ links to
user_info (Owner personal data)
    ↓ defines
ubm_owner_ownership_type (Ownership type/percentage)
```

**Business Integration Flow:**
```
user_business_mapping
    ↓ via related_business_solution_mapping_id
related_business_solution_mapping (Business-Solution link)
    ↓ business_id
business (Business entity)
    ↓ solution_id  
solution_additional_info (Solution metadata)
```

**Document & Address Flow:**
```
user_business_mapping_owner
    ↓ ubm_owner_id
ubm_owner_document_mapping
    ↓ document_id
document (Document storage)

user_business_mapping_owner
    ↓ ubm_owner_id
ubm_owner_address_mapping
    ↓ address_id
address (Address storage)
```

**Workflow & Processing Flow:**
```
user_business_mapping
    ↓ triggers
workflow_status (State tracking)
    ↓ spawns
job (Background processing)
    ↓ logs to
generic_audit (API audit trail)
```

**Complex Query Data Flow:**
```
fetchUBMByOwnershipTypeAndSolutionTypeAndStatusAndPanAndCustId():
user_business_mapping → ubm_owner_ownership_type → user_business_mapping_owner → 
related_business_solution_mapping → business → user_info (6-table join)

fetchUBMBySolutionSolutionTypeLevel2AndStatusAndUbmaiKeyValue():
user_business_mapping → related_business_solution_mapping → 
solution_additional_info → business (4-table join for KYB integration)
```

## ✅ Stage-to-Validation Mapping (what gates each node)

| Node (Stage / Sub-Stage / Alias) | Required Validations | SAI Keys (examples) | RBSMAI Keys (examples) | Job/Trigger | Next Gate (typical) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AGREEMENT_UPLOAD / AGREEMENT_WAIVEOFF_UPLOAD_SUCCESS | Agreement addendum uploaded/waived; approver, DMS | AGREEMENT_STATUS, AGREEMENT_WAIVE_OFF, AGREEMENT_ADDENDUM_UUID, AGREEMENT_ADDENDUM_AUTH_SIGNATORY, AGREEMENT_EXPIRY_DATE | AGREEMENT_DETAILS | Agreement upload/waiver job | Move to KYB/Validation or PG config checks |
| KYB_POST / KYB_SUCCESS / VALIDATION_PENDING (id 124) | PAN/GST/KYB status, identity coherency | PAN_VERIFICATION_STATUS, TP_PAN_VERIFICATION_STATUS, GSTIN_STATUS, NAME_AS_PER_NSDL, LEGAL_NAME_BAHN_NAME_MATCH_* | JOCATA_AML_CHECK_RESPONSE (if AML tied to KYB), NAME_MATCH_STATUS | KYBSyncJob | Bank LOB / MDR / Risk (Maquette) |
| RISK / MAQUETTE_PASS | Risk score/limits assigned | MAQUETTE_STATUS, PG_MAX_AMT_DAY, PG_MAX_AMT_MONTH, PPI_LIMIT | MAQUETTE_REQUEST, MAQUETTE_RESPONSE | Risk evaluation job | PG config / LOB approvals |
| BANK / BANK_VERIFICATION_APPROVED | Penny drop + name match; account type | PENNY_DROP_STATUS, BANK_VERIFICATION_STATUS, BANK_ACCOUNT_TYPE, ACCOUNT_TYPE_RECEIVED_FROM_PD | NAME_MATCH_STATUS | KYB/Bank verify job | Bank LOB approval / MDR finalization |
| MDR / COMMERCIAL_APPROVAL_SUCCESS | Benchmark/MDR validated or approved | IS_BENCHMARKING_PASS, CONVENIENCE_FEE_TYPE, PRODUCT_TYPE | MDR_LINE_ITEMS, FINAL_MDR_LINE_ITEMS, INTEGRATION_CHARGES | Benchmark/MDR job | PG_REQUEST submit / approval |
| BANK_LOB / APPROVALS_DONE | CC/DC banks approved for instruments | IS_DINERS_REQUIRED_FOR_CC | BANK_LOB_APPROVAL_RESPONSE | LOB approval job | PG config finalization |
| PG / REQUEST_SUBMITTED | PG config constructed/submitted | PG_REQUEST_ID, PLATFORM, FLOW_TYPE, SUB_MODEL, SETTLEMENT_TYPE/STRATEGY | PG_REQUEST | PGMerchantCreationJob | Activation/Go‑Live gating |
| AML / AML_CLEAR | AML cleared/not flagged | IS_MERCHANT_AML_FLAGGED, AML_RISK_CATEGORY | JOCATA_AML_CHECK_RESPONSE | AML job | Final activation or manual review if flagged |
| DOC / COMMERCIAL_DOC_UPLOAD_REQUIRED | Required docs present | COMMERCIAL_DOC_UPLOAD_REQUIRED | DOC_REJECTION_AUDIT | DocumentValidationJob | Proceed to agreement/risk |

Notes:
- SUBSTAGE_COUNT in SAI tracks how many times sub‑stages fired (e.g., PANEL_SUCCESS, BANK_LOB_SUCCESS, AGREEMENT_*).
- RBSMAI holds heavy payloads/approvals; SAI holds the distilled status/booleans used for gating.
- workflow_edge conditions typically read SAI/RBSMAI/UBMAI to allow transitions; jobs populate those keys.

### ℹ️ Editability Scope (generic vs per-record)

- Source of truth: `editable_field_workflow_mapping` defines which fields can be edited at a given `workflow_node_id` (and optionally `workflow_definition_id`). This is a generic (template) configuration per node/stage, not a row targeted to a specific lead.
- How it applies to a record: a lead's current node (latest `workflow_status`) is joined to this map to derive what the UI/API should allow at that moment.
- Per-record exceptions are indirect and driven by:
  - `threshold_workflow_node_id` (field becomes editable only after/before specific nodes)
  - `field_meta_info` (JSON hints: constraints/visibility rules)
  - Runtime flags in SAI/UBMAI/RBSMAI (e.g., gating by AML/risk outcomes)
- Practical implication: the same node exposes the same "field_key/action" set for all leads on that node, unless those indirect conditions restrict visibility/editing for a particular case.

### **🔄 Critical Data Flow Patterns:**

#### **1. Lead Creation Data Flow:**
```
User Input → Controller → Service → DAO → Database
Form Data → SolutionLeadController.createSolutionLead() → 
LeadManagementService.createLead() → UserBusinessMappingDaoImpl.save() → 
user_business_mapping table → Cascade to related tables
```

#### **2. Document Processing Data Flow:**
```
Document Upload → Document Validation → Storage → Mapping
File → Frontend → document table → 
ubm_owner_document_mapping/business_document_mapping → 
Trigger DocumentValidationJob → Update status → Workflow progression
```

#### **3. Payment Processing Data Flow:**
```
Business Details → Financial Validation → Bank Integration → Gateway Setup
Bank Details → bank_details table → Trigger PGMerchantCreationJob → 
Bank APIs → related_business_solution_mapping_additional_info → 
MDR_LINE_ITEMS → BANK_LOB_APPROVAL_RESPONSE → PG_REQUEST
```

#### **4. Workflow Progression Data Flow:**
```
Business Event → Job Creation → Processing → State Update → Next Stage
Event → CommonUtils.triggerLeadWorkflow() → job table → 
Background processor → External API calls → Metadata updates → 
workflow_status → workflow_node → workflow_edge → Next jobs
```

#### **5. Audit Trail Data Flow:**
```
All Operations → Multi-level Audit Capture → Compliance Tracking
System Operations → audit_trail (session tracking) + 
generic_audit (API calls) + audit_event (workflow events) + 
user_business_mapping_aud (entity changes) → Complete audit picture
```

### **🎯 Data Flow Performance Optimizations:**

#### **Query Optimization Patterns:**
- **Native SQL**: Used for complex multi-table joins (6+ tables)
- **HQL**: Used for standard CRUD operations with entity relationships
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- **Connection Pooling**: Separate read/write transaction managers for performance

#### **Caching Strategy:**
- **Redis**: Session data and frequently accessed reference data
- **Application Cache**: Metadata configurations and lookup tables
- **Database Cache**: Hibernate second-level cache for entity caching

#### **Asynchronous Processing:**
- **Job Queue**: Background processing for heavy operations
- **Workflow Engine**: Non-blocking state transitions
- **External Integrations**: Asynchronous API calls with callback handling

SELECT * FROM user_business_mapping WHERE lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID';

-- Step 2: Get complete lead hierarchy
SELECT 
    ubm.lead_id,
    ubm.solution_type,
    ubm.status,
    rbsm.id as rbsm_id,
    b.name as business_name
FROM user_business_mapping ubm
JOIN related_business_solution_mapping rbsm ON ubm.related_business_solution_mapping_id = rbsm.id
JOIN business b ON rbsm.business_id = b.id
WHERE ubm.lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID';

-- Step 3: Check workflow progression
SELECT 
    ws.created_at,
    wn.stage,
    wn.sub_stage,
    wn.alias
FROM workflow_status ws
JOIN workflow_node wn ON ws.workflow_node_id = wn.id
WHERE ws.user_business_mapping_id = YOUR_UBM_ID
ORDER BY ws.created_at;

-- Step 4: Check background jobs
SELECT * FROM job 
WHERE context_val = YOUR_UBM_ID 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Step 5: Check metadata
SELECT rbsm_key, LEFT(info, 100) as info_preview
FROM related_business_solution_mapping_additional_info
WHERE related_business_solution_mapping_id = YOUR_RBSM_ID
ORDER BY created_at;
```

#### **🧪 How to Create a Test Lead End-to-End:**
```java
// 1. Create Lead Request
SolutionLeadRequest request = new SolutionLeadRequest();
request.setBusinessName("Test Business Ltd");
request.setEntityType("PROPRIETORSHIP");
request.setSolutionType("enterprise_merchant_business");

// 2. Call Controller
ResponseEntity<String> response = solutionLeadController.createSolutionLead(request);

// 3. Verify Database Entry
String leadId = extractLeadIdFromResponse(response);
UserBusinessMapping ubm = userBusinessMappingDao.findByLeadId(leadId);

// 4. Trigger Workflow
CommonUtils.triggerLeadWorkflow(leadId, "KYBSyncJob", ubm.getId());
```

#### **📊 Essential Development Queries:**

**Monitor Lead Processing:**
```sql
-- Real-time job monitoring
SELECT 
    j.job_type,
    j.status,
    j.created_at,
    j.retry_count,
    ubm.lead_id
FROM job j
JOIN user_business_mapping ubm ON j.context_val = ubm.id
WHERE j.created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ORDER BY j.created_at DESC;

-- Check for stuck workflows
SELECT 
    ubm.lead_id,
    ubm.solution_type,
    ws.created_at as last_update,
    wn.stage,
    wn.sub_stage
FROM user_business_mapping ubm
JOIN workflow_status ws ON ws.user_business_mapping_id = ubm.id
JOIN workflow_node wn ON ws.workflow_node_id = wn.id
WHERE ws.created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 DAY)
AND ubm.status = 0;
```

**Development Data Cleanup:**
```sql
-- Clean up test leads (USE WITH CAUTION!)
DELETE FROM user_business_mapping 
WHERE lead_id LIKE 'TEST_%' 
AND created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING & DEBUGGING GUIDE**

### **🚨 Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: Lead Stuck in Workflow**
**Symptoms**: Lead not progressing, no recent workflow_status updates
**Debugging Steps**:
```sql
-- Check current workflow status
SELECT 
    ws.created_at,
    wn.stage,
    wn.sub_stage,
    wn.description
FROM workflow_status ws
JOIN workflow_node wn ON ws.workflow_node_id = wn.id
WHERE ws.user_business_mapping_id = YOUR_UBM_ID
ORDER BY ws.created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check for failed jobs
SELECT * FROM job 
WHERE context_val = YOUR_UBM_ID 
AND status = 'FAILED'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check for missing metadata
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM related_business_solution_mapping_additional_info
WHERE related_business_solution_mapping_id = YOUR_RBSM_ID;
```
**Solution**: Retry failed jobs or manually trigger next workflow stage

#### **Issue 2: Payment Gateway Integration Failures**
**Symptoms**: BANK_LOB_APPROVAL_RESPONSE missing or failed
**Debugging Steps**:
```sql
-- Check bank approvals
SELECT 
    rbsm_key,
    info,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM related_business_solution_mapping_additional_info
WHERE related_business_solution_mapping_id = YOUR_RBSM_ID
AND rbsm_key = 'BANK_LOB_APPROVAL_RESPONSE';

-- Check PG request status
SELECT * FROM generic_audit
WHERE lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID'
AND oe_api LIKE '%bank%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### **Issue 3: Document Upload/Validation Issues**
**Debugging Steps**:
```sql
-- Check document status
SELECT 
    d.doc_type,
    d.status,
    d.created_at,
    uodm.created_at as mapping_created
FROM document d
JOIN ubm_owner_document_mapping uodm ON d.id = uodm.document_id
JOIN user_business_mapping_owner ubmo ON uodm.ubm_owner_id = ubmo.id
JOIN user_business_mapping ubm ON ubmo.user_business_mapping_id = ubm.id
WHERE ubm.lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID';

-- Check document validation jobs
SELECT * FROM job
WHERE job_type = 'DocumentValidationJob'
AND context_val = YOUR_UBM_ID
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **🔍 Advanced Debugging Techniques:**

#### **Audit Trail Analysis:**
```sql
-- Complete audit timeline for a lead
SELECT 
    'GENERIC_AUDIT' as type,
    oe_api as action,
    created_at,
    NULL as additional_info
FROM generic_audit 
WHERE lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'AUDIT_EVENT' as type,
    'workflow_change' as action,
    created_at,
    workflow_status_id as additional_info
FROM audit_event
WHERE created_at BETWEEN 'START_DATE' AND 'END_DATE'

ORDER BY created_at;
```

#### **Performance Analysis:**
```sql
-- Check for slow queries affecting your lead
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as query_count,
    job_type,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, created_at, updated_at)) as avg_duration_minutes
FROM job
WHERE context_val = YOUR_UBM_ID
GROUP BY job_type
ORDER BY avg_duration_minutes DESC;
```

#### **Data Consistency Checks:**
```sql
-- Verify data consistency across tables
SELECT 
    'UBM Count' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_business_mapping
WHERE lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Owner Count' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_business_mapping_owner ubmo
JOIN user_business_mapping ubm ON ubmo.user_business_mapping_id = ubm.id
WHERE ubm.lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Workflow Status Count' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM workflow_status ws
JOIN user_business_mapping ubm ON ws.user_business_mapping_id = ubm.id
WHERE ubm.lead_id = 'YOUR_LEAD_ID';
```

## 🏆 **BEST PRACTICES & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **💻 Code Best Practices:**

#### **Database Access Patterns:**
```java
// ✅ GOOD: Use appropriate transaction manager
@Transactional(value = BaseConstants.HIBERNATE_TRANSACTION_MANAGER_SLAVE, readOnly = true)
public List<UserBusinessMapping> fetchReadOnlyData() {
    return dao.findAll();
}

@Transactional(value = BaseConstants.HIBERNATE_TRANSACTION_MANAGER_MASTER)
public void saveData(UserBusinessMapping ubm) {
    dao.save(ubm);
}

// ✅ GOOD: Use native SQL for complex business logic
@Query(value = "SELECT ubm.* FROM user_business_mapping ubm " +
               "JOIN related_business_solution_mapping rbsm ON ubm.related_business_solution_mapping_id = rbsm.id " +
               "WHERE rbsm.business_id = :businessId", nativeQuery = true)
List<UserBusinessMapping> findByComplexBusinessLogic(@Param("businessId") Long businessId);

// ❌ AVOID: HQL for complex multi-table joins (use native SQL instead)
```

#### **Workflow Management:**
```java
// ✅ GOOD: Always use CommonUtils for workflow triggers
CommonUtils.triggerLeadWorkflow(leadId, jobType, contextValue);

// ✅ GOOD: Handle job failures gracefully
if (job.getRetryCount() < MAX_RETRIES) {
    job.setStatus(JobStatus.PENDING);
    job.setRetryCount(job.getRetryCount() + 1);
} else {
    job.setStatus(JobStatus.FAILED);
    // Trigger manual review workflow
}
```

#### **Error Handling:**
```java
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive error logging with context
try {
    processLead(leadId);
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Lead processing failed for leadId: {}, ubmId: {}, error: {}", 
              leadId, ubmId, e.getMessage(), e);
    // Update audit trail
    auditService.logError(leadId, "LEAD_PROCESSING_FAILED", e.getMessage());
}
```

### **🗄️ Database Best Practices:**

#### **Query Optimization:**
- **Use indexes** on frequently queried columns (lead_id, created_at, status)
- **Limit result sets** with appropriate WHERE clauses and LIMIT statements
- **Use EXPLAIN** to analyze query performance
- **Batch operations** for bulk updates

#### **Data Integrity:**
- **Always validate** foreign key relationships before saves
- **Use transactions** for multi-table operations
- **Implement soft deletes** instead of hard deletes for audit trail
- **Encrypt sensitive data** (PAN, bank details, addresses)

### **🔒 Security Best Practices:**

#### **Data Protection:**
```java
// ✅ GOOD: Always encrypt sensitive data
String encryptedPan = OECryptoService.encrypt(panNumber);
business.setPan(encryptedPan);

// ✅ GOOD: Validate input data
if (!ValidationUtils.isValidPAN(panNumber)) {
    throw new ValidationException("Invalid PAN format");
}
```

#### **Access Control:**
- **Role-based access** to sensitive APIs
- **Audit all operations** for compliance
- **Rate limiting** on public APIs
- **Input validation** on all user inputs

### **📊 Monitoring & Observability:**

#### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
```sql
-- Lead processing throughput
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    solution_type,
    COUNT(*) as leads_created,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 1 THEN 1 END) as leads_completed
FROM user_business_mapping
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), solution_type;

-- Job failure rates
SELECT 
    job_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'FAILED' THEN 1 END) as failed_jobs,
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'FAILED' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as failure_rate
FROM job
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY job_type
ORDER BY failure_rate DESC;
```

#### **Alerting Recommendations:**
- **High job failure rates** (>5% for critical jobs)
- **Stuck workflows** (no progress for >24 hours)
- **Database connection issues**
- **External service timeouts**
- **Security violations** (failed authentication attempts)

### **🚀 Performance Optimization:**

#### **Database Optimizations:**
- **Connection pooling**: Optimize pool sizes based on load
- **Read replicas**: Use for read-heavy operations
- **Query caching**: Cache frequently accessed reference data

## ✅ Validation Outcome Snapshot (interpretation of core SAI keys)

These keys reflect that identity, tax, risk and limits have passed for the solution instance (as validated via SAI and joins to RBSM/UBM):

- Identity & Tax
  - PAN_VERIFICATION_STATUS = Verified; TP_PAN_VERIFICATION_STATUS = PASS → PAN verified (third‑party) and accepted.
  - GSTIN_STATUS = GSTExempted; ANNUAL_TURNOVER = "Rs. 0 to 20 lakhs" → GST‑exempt flow; turnover bucket recorded.
  - SEGMENT = "Automobiles and Vehicles"; SUB_SEGMENT = "Authorized Service Centre" → business classification set.

- Risk & Limits
  - MAQUETTE_STATUS = PASS → risk engine approved; limits can be assigned.
  - PG_MAX_AMT_DAY = 100000.00; PG_MAX_AMT_MONTH = 200000.00; PPI_LIMIT = 0 → final assigned caps.

- Practical impact on workflow
  - With PAN/GST/risk accepted and limits set, workflow advances beyond KYB/risk gates toward bank LOB/MDR/Agreement checks (as applicable) and PG configuration/activation.
  - Remaining gates are typically read from RBSMAI/SAI (e.g., BANK_LOB_APPROVAL_RESPONSE, FINAL_MDR_LINE_ITEMS, AGREEMENT_* keys) before final activation.
